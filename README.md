This study evaluates the potential of computer vision to transform sign language gestures into text. For those who are deaf or hearing-impaired, sign language is a vital tool of communication. Yet, in scenarios that require written or verbal forms of communication, it can prove to be a hurdle. To this end, the proposed solution puts to use computer vision algorithms to recognize and decode sign language movements, followed by real-time transformation of this information into written text. Aimed to be available, fast and precise, the system is tried and tested by users with hearing loss. Results of the trials emphasize the effectiveness of computer vision technology in facilitating communication for those whose primary language is sign language. Lastly, the paper deliberates on further areas of exploration, such as its integration into education, healthcare and other environments where communication is vital.

This study investigated a system using Random Forest machine learning algorithm and a CNN model, to recognize sign language gestures. After the dataset of sign language videos was pre-processed to identify pertinent features, they were fed into the model, allowing it to recognize different gestures. Various metrics, including accuracy, speed, and user experience, were employed to evaluate the system, with high accuracy and the capacity for real-time text output found. Additionally, the system is highly user-friendly and needs minimal instruction, making it an excellent choice for a variety of people, especially the deaf and hard of hearing.
